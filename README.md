## Description
Maps is a simple TypeScript application that generates random names and locations for users, as well as random company names, catchphrases, and locations. The Faker API handles the random generation. The generated locations are displayed on a Google Map using markers. Clicking on these markers reveals a pop-up window with details about the user or company.
